# EC530-Assignment1
This repository is for the first assignment for EC530, where we had to write a program which, if the user provides two arrays of geo location, matches each point in the first array to the closest one in the second array. For this, I used the Haversine function to find the distance between a point in the first array and a point in the second array. 

The way that this program works is it asks for the user to firstly enter the size of the first array and then subsequently enter each point in the first array in a specified format. It then asks the user to enter the size of the second array and then enter each point in the second array in the same specified format. 

The program then calls the Haversine function, which first converts the entry in the first array into latitude and longitude.
